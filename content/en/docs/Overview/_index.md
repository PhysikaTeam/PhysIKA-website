## What is it?

PhysIKA is short fo Physics-based Interactive Kinematics Architecture. It is an open source node-based architecture targeted at real-time simulation of versatile physical materials. Currently, it supports simulating physical phenomena ranging from fluids, elastic objects and fracture, etc. It is higly modualized and can also help the research community develop novel algorithms.

## What can I expect from PhysIKA?

Followings are a set of features making PhysIKA unique to simulate a complex physical senario in a efficient way: 

* **Template programming**: PhysIKA support a wide class of commonly used data structre in the form of templates.

* **Highly modularized**: The whole is modularized from top to bottom, therefore, custom behaviors can easily obtained by extending existing components.

* **Complex coupling**: It supports the coupling of a variety of different physical materials.

* **High performance**: The architecture is highly optimized to improve the execuation performance.
